# Text-Decoding-Effect
Sample for decoding text in Javascript

I've planned to make this more optimized, scalable and with many other features.
My goal was to make this work ony any browser with any fonts.
I was planning to make some money of it through Google App (but that's just too much hassle for nothing, I guess)
but as I am inpatient I just released it here on GITHUB
in hope to find more better ways to improve this HTML script.
Script is not well documented/organized as you can see.
There were so many ideas running through my mind about this project.
But "time" is not on my side.
I am "half" self-taught coder.
I tried to incorporate as many options I could.
Design is basic with some off things.
Basically, putting this on GITHUB is my saying of I quit to work on this alone. Or is it?
Wish I knew what am I looking for.
